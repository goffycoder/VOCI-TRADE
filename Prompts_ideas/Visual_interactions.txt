the visual interaction should be more interactive and user friendly. and the blob should be more attractive and eye catchy. with some animation effects. glowing around it when user hovers over it. and when user clicks on it the blob should change its color and start listening to voice commands. and when user stops speaking the blob should stop listening and go back to its of processing 
state. and the blob should also have some sound effects when user hovers over it and clicks on it. like a soft chime sound when user hovers over it and a click sound when user clicks on it. and the blob should also have some visual feedback when it is listening to voice commands. like a pulsing effect or a waveform animation. overall the visual interaction should be smooth and seamless and should enhance the user experience.
